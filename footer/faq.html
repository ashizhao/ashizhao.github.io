    <p>There is an additional series of frequently asked questions and answers at the
    <a href="http://www.earthscope.org/usarray/USArrayFAQ.htm">EarthScope USArray website</a>.</p>

    <a name="usarray" id="usarray"></a><h3>What is USArray?</h3>
    <p>You can learn about the USArray component of the EarthScope experiment by
    clicking <a href="http://www.earthscope.org/usarray/index.php">here</a>.</p>

    <a name="archive" id="archive"></a><h3>Where is the data collected by USArray stored?</h3>
    <p>The data collected by USArray is stored at the Incorporated Research
    Institutions for Seismology (<a href="http://www.iris.edu">IRIS</a>) Data
    Management Center (<a href="http://www.iris.edu/about/DMC/">DMC</a>).<br/>
    Click <a href="http://www.iris.edu/data/data.htm" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more.</p>

    <a name="movie" id="movie"></a><h3>Is there a movie that I can watch that shows the USArray deployment?</h3>
    <p>High&ndash;resolution and iPhone formatted movies of both the
    rolling and cumulative station deployment can be viewed on the
    <a href="/stations/deployment_history.php">Monthly Deployment
    History page</a>.</p>

    <a name="whatis" id="whatis"></a><h3>What is the ANF?</h3>
    <p>Click <a href="/about/">here</a> for more information.</p>

    <a name="resp" id="resp"></a><h3>What are the responsibilities of the ANF?</h3>
    <p>The ANF is responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Monitoring the state of health for the Transportable Array (TA).</li>
        <li>Performing quality control checks on the TA stations (noise spectra, timing, etc).</li>
        <li>Having an analyst actually looking at the data on a daily basis so subtle changes in data quality can be noted.</li>
        <li>Monitoring communications between dataloggers and the ANF.</li>
        <li>Coordinating with Robert Busby (Chief of Operations for Transportable Array Deployment) any field maintenance that needs to be done.</li>
        <li>Assuring a redundant backup of data in case the DMC loses data feeds (30+ days).</li>
        <li>Maintaining metadata for the entire TA network.</li>
        <li>Providing a world-wide web (WWW) interface for access to TA information and special events that occur during the TA deployment.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="map" id="map"></a><h3>Why does the station map take so long to load?</h3>
    <p>The station map is created dynamically, communicating with the station database
    to ensure the most recent USArray station deployments are plotted. This is why there is a date-stamp
    at the base of the image in the legend noting how many stations were online at that precise time.</p>
    <p>The station map should load in under 10 seconds if you are on a T1 connection, in under 30 seconds
    if you are using a 56K modem, but up to 120 seconds if you are using a 28K modem. Please be patient
    and wait for the image to load &ndash; there is a lot of information being processed to create the image.</p>

    <a name="cols" id="cols"></a><h3>What do the column headings in the station table mean?</h3>
    <p>The station table has six columns &mdash; Station ID, Station Name, Latitude, Longitude,
    Elevation and Ondate. The Station ID is a unique identifier to each respective station. The
    Station Name either describes the location of the station, or is a particular location.
    Latitude is in degrees (&deg;) north, so a negative number means that the station is south
    of the equator. Longitude is in degrees (&deg;) east, so a negative number means that the
    station is west of the <a href="http://greenwichmeridian.com/">Greenwich meridian</a> in
    London, England (the location of zero degrees longitude). Elevation is the height above sea
    level in meters.</p>
    <p>The Ondate is a number that is a combination of the year (four values) and the
    <a href="http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/cal_art.html">Julian Day</a>
    (three values) and refers to the last time something was modified at that station (ie. a new
    sensor was installed, a different sample rate was implemented, etc.).  Thus, an ondate of
    2004100 does not mean that the station first started operating in 2004, only that a change in
    its setup occurred then: it could have been operational for 25 years prior to the reported
    &ldquo;ondate&rdquo;.</p>

    <a name="solutions" id="solutions"></a><h3>Why are there several
    solutions for the same event, often with different magnitudes
    and locations?</h3>
    <p>There are several reasons for different reporting bodies
    producing different locations and magnitudes for the same
    earthquake. The most fundamental cause is the location and number
    of seismic stations that recorded the earthquake. The magnitude and the location
    of a given earthquake is preferably determined using more than one
    seismic station. A suite of seismic stations distributed around the
    earthquake's epicenter and have a range of source/station distances can
    typically yield better location and magnitude estimates than a single
    station far away. However, other factors can also introduce
    additional deviations in the measurement such as differences in the
    recording capabilities of the seismic sensors, the seismic analyst
    making the measurement and variations in the geology and tectonics of
    the region. A rule of thumb used by some seismologists is that
    magnitude estimates can typically deviate by 0.5 magnitude units, and
    the mapped location of the earthquake (latitude, longitude) is often
    known in greater detail than the depth of the earthquake (distance from
    the Earth's surface to the earthquake's hypocenter).</p>
    <p>A second variable is by what process the event is measured, and
    which scale is used. There are four different measurement scales
    &mdash; surface wave magnitude (Ms), body wave magnitude (mb),
    moment magnitude (Mw), and local magnitude (Ml).</p>

        <li><a href="/faq/operations/dbloc2/">dbloc2 and dbpick Procedure for Locating and Associating Events</a></li>
        <li><a href="/faq/operations/orb2orb/">I am a regional network operator
        and would like to collect stations of interest to me via orb2orb.
        How do I do that without getting all stations being collected
        at the ANF?</a></li>
    </ul>

    <a name="naming" id="naming"></a><h3>What criteria do you use to name a new station/site?</h3>
    <p>A Transportable Array station code is 4 characters long.
    The first three characters of a new station's station code are
    based on its geographic location. The last (fourth) character
    identifies the sequence of stations installed at this grid point.
    Often the first planned site had complications that prevented
    its inclusion, so instead of "<b>A</b>", you will see "<b>B</b>" or "<b>C</b>", and
    so on. Normally only one station would lie in a grid point but
    if a station must be relocated the scheme must easily support this
    possibility. A fifth character is possible for SEED station codes,
    however this character is undefined for the present time.</p>

    <p>The geographic based naming convention is based on a grid
    system with geographic placement amongst the rows and columns
    defining a different part of the station code. There are rows
    of stations A, B, C, etc. starting at the Canadian border and
    incrementing an idealized every 75 km or so until reaching
    the border with Mexico and columns starting at "<b>01</b>" at the
    westernmost point in the US deployment plan and incrementing by
    one as you move approximately every 75 km to the east. More than
    26 rows are needed to accomplish this gridding so after "<b>Z</b>"
    comes a station starting with "<b>1</b>". Less than 99 columns (64
    in total) are needed to accomplish this gridding, so the 2nd
    and 3rd characters will always be numeric. Thus the station
    code takes its first character based on its latitude and the
    numeric second and third characters are based on its longitude.
    Due to the obvious difficulties with siting, the idealized 75km
    grid spacing is adjusted to fit the conditions in the area.</p>

    <p>Let's take as an example station <b>A12A</b>. The first "<b>A</b>" tells
    us that this is a 'northern' site near the border with Canada.
    The "<b>12</b>" tells us that it is 12 grid points in from the
    westernmost point in the deployment grid. Very approximately
    that is 12*75 km from the westernmost point. The final "<b>A</b>"
    tells us this was the first location for a station at this grid
    point. This ends up being a site in Montana.</p>

    <p>Prior to final installation and certification, site codes
    include a dash followed by a number that identifies the
    classification of the site.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>A12A-0</b> is an initial site for the station location <b>A12A</b></li>
        <li><b>A12A-1</b> is a potential site for the station location <b>A12A</b></li>
        <li><b>A12A-2</b> is another potential site for the station location <b>A12A</b></li>
        <li><b>A12A-3</b> is a third potential site for the station location <b>A12A</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When one of the potential sites is permitted it is referred
    to by the station code <b>A12A</b>. The SEED station code is the station
    code, the Network code for USArray Transportable Array is <b>TA</b>. You
    may seed a station code written as <b>TA.A12A</b> or <b>TA_A12A</b>.</p>

    <a name="hosting" id="hosting"></a><h3>How can I host a USArray station?</h3>
    <p>If you are interested in hosting a seismic station on your property
    please <a href="http://www.iris.edu/USArray/landowners/host_a_site.html">visit the IRIS webpage</a>
    dedicated to this. You can also <a href="http://www.iris.edu/USArray/publications/hosting.pdf">download
    a PDF information brochure</a>. Thank you for your interest.</p>

    <a name="snoflu" id="snoflu"></a><h3>What is SNOFLU?</h3>
    <p>SNOFLU is an acronym for Sudden Noise Onset Fixed by Lock/Unlock. It is a known sensor issue
    with certain datalogger types, when for no apparent reason the station channel(s) start to get noisy.
    This is fixed by a physical mass position lock and unlock process on the sensor.</p>
