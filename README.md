## Design for ANF home page

My work with Scripps/IGPP Institute included designing the web page for The Array Network Facility (ANF), who ensures that all the realâ€“time data and metadata collected from US seismic stations are transmitted, checked for quality, and accessible online for researchers and the general public.
